/* 
What Are Variables?

Variables are used to store data. In JavaScript, variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, or objects.

Declaring Variables:

JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables:

var: Function-scoped, can be redeclared.

let: Block-scoped, cannot be redeclared within the same scope.

const: Block-scoped, constant values.

Data Types:

Primitive Types:

String: Text (e.g., "Hello")

Number: Integer or decimal (e.g., 42, 3.14)

Boolean: true or false

Undefined: Variable declared but not assigned

Null: Intentional empty value

Symbol: Unique identifiers (used rarely)

Non-Primitive Types:

Objects: Collections of key-value pairs

Arrays: Lists of values
